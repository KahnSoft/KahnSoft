ðŸš€ Multi-Domain Vision & Engineering Systems Architecture
33 Years of Industrial Software Engineering Excellence (1992-2025)
---
Overview
A comprehensive multi-domain engineering platform built over 33 years, featuring 250,000+ hand-written C++ lines across 22+ specialized projects. This architecture demonstrates revolutionary approaches to industrial vision, real-time processing, neural navigation, and cross-domain integration.

Core Architecture Principles
Universal 5-Action Philosophy
Every camera interface reduced to essential operations:
â€¢	GetFrame() - Image acquisition
â€¢	Start() - Capture initiation
â€¢	Stop() - Capture termination
â€¢	SetTrigger() - Hardware control
â€¢	ComInfo() - Parameter management
Multi-Domain Integration
Single codebase serves multiple engineering disciplines through intelligent abstraction layers and Lua scripting interfaces.
